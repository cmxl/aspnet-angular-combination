# aspnet-angular-combination
A small solution with an Angular and an ASP.NET Core project working together as a SPA.

---

## Run it

First build the angular project `noobit-ngx`
```cmd
npm run build
```
Files will be automatically copied to the `wwwroot` folder in the `noobit-mvc` project.
Then just start the `noobit-mvc` project via the solution or just
```cmd
dotnet run
```
